  introduction: |-
    [Red Hat® JBoss® Enterprise Application Platform (EAP)](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/jboss-middleware/application-platform) is an application server. It includes everything needed to build, run, deploy, and manage enterprise Java applications in a variety of environments, including on-premise, virtual environments, and in private, public, and hybrid clouds.

    * **Optimized for OpenShift, Cloud and Containers**

    * **Jakarta EE 8 compatibility**

    * **Lightweight, flexible architecture**

    * **Red Hat Portfolio Integration**

    * **More productive developers with DevOps and Agile Development**

    With this quick start, you can deploy and run a [Jakarta EE application](https://github.com/jboss-eap-up-and-running/eap7-getting-started) with JBoss EAP 7 on OpenShift.

    **Note:** The quickstart uses a sample [Jakarta EE application](https://github.com/jboss-eap-up-and-running/eap7-getting-started). You can deploy your own Jakarta EE application using the same steps.
    The quick start has instructions where changes would be needed (Task 1).

  tasks:
    - description: >-
        To create a JBoss EAP 7 application:
        
        1. In the main navigation, click the dropdown menu [perspective switcher]{{highlight qs-perspective-switcher}} and select **Developer**.
        
        1. In the navigation menu, click [Add]{{highlight qs-nav-add}}.  
           The **Add** page opens.

        1. In the **Add** page, click **Helm Chart**.
        
        1. In the **Helm Charts** catalog, search for **JBoss EAP 7.4**.
        
        1. Click the **JBoss EAP 7.4**  Helm chart card.

            - The side panel displays information about the JBoss EAP 7 Helm chart.

        1. Click **Install Helm Chart**.
        
            - Some form sections are collapsed by default. Click **>** to expand and view its content.  
              **Note:** No updates are required to these sections to proceed.

            - The details about the [Jakarta EE application](https://github.com/jboss-eap-up-and-running/eap7-getting-started) that you are building and deploying are specified in the `build.uri` field:

              ```
              build:
                  uri: https://github.com/jboss-eap-up-and-running/eap7-getting-started
              ```

              **Note:** If you are building a different application, you must change this `uri` field to point to the Git repository of that application.

        1.  Click **Install** to create the JBoss EAP 7 application using the Helm Chart.

            - The console switches to the [Topology]{{highlight qs-nav-topology}} view and displays a pane with the Helm Release notes.
              After you read the notes, you can close the pane.

        instructions: |-
          The Helm release is represented by a dashed box that contains the JBoss EAP icon and **eap74** text. This content is placed outside the dashed box.

          The deployment is indicated by a circle inside the dashed box with text **D eap74**.

          Verify the application was successfully created:
          
          - Do you see an **eap74** Helm Release?
          
          - Do you see an **eap74** deployment?

      summary:
        failed: Try the steps again.
        success: Your JBoss EAP7 application has been deployed onto OpenShift.

        To view the Helm release:

        1. In the navigation menu, click [Helm]{{highlight qs-nav-helm}}.

        1. Click **eap74** Helm release.  
           The **Helm Release details** page opens. It shows all the information related to the Helm release that you installed.

           -  Click the **Resources** tab. It lists all the resources created by this Helm release.

          Verify you see the Helm release:

          - Do you see a **Deployed** label next to the Helm Release **eap74**?
      summary:

        success: Your Helm release for JBoss EAP 7 is deployed.

        To view the associated code:

        1. In the navigation menu, click [Topology]{{highlight qs-nav-topology}}.  
           In the Topology view, the **eap74** deployment displays a code icon in the bottom right-hand corner. This icon either represents the Git repository
           of the associated code, or if the appropriate operators are installed, it will bring up the associated code in your IDE.

        1. If the icon shown is CodeReady Workspaces or Eclipse Che, clicking the icon opens the associated code in your IDE.

        1. If the icon represents a Git repository, clicking the icon opens the associated Git repository.

        To view the build status of the JBoss EAP 7 application:

        1. In the navigation menu, click [Topology]{{highlight qs-nav-topology}}.

        1. In the Topology view, click **D eap74**.  
           A side panel opens with detailed information about the application.

        1. In the side panel, click the **Resources** tab.  
           The **Builds** section shows all the details related to builds of the application.

        The JBoss EAP 7 application is built in two steps:

          - The first build configuration **eap74-build-artifacts** compiles and packages the Jakarta EE application, and creates a JBoss EAP server.
            The application is run on this JBoss EAP server.

            The build may take a few minutes to complete. The build state is indicated by a relevant message such as **Pending**, **Running**, and **Complete**.

            When the build is complete, a checkmark and the following message is displayed: **Build #1 was complete**.

            When the first build is complete, the second build starts.

          - The second build configuration **eap74** puts the Jakarta EE deployment and the JBoss EAP server in a runtime image that contains only what is required to run the  application.

            When the second build is complete, a checkmark and the following message are displayed: **Build #2 was complete**.
