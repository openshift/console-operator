# Console Operator 

An operator for OpenShift Console built using the operator-sdk.

The console-operator installs and maintains the web console on a cluster.

## Setup


```bash  
# you may need to fiddle around with $GOPATH
echo $GOPATH // /Users/bpeterse/go
GOPATH=$(pwd)
# NOTE: I need to reference gvm pkgset here
```


## Building

```bash 
# When you make changes be sure to run the command to generate code: 
operator-sdk generate k8s

# Then use the sdk to build your image. I've tended to build with a 
# simple name, then re-tag to push to hub.docker, quay.io or gitlab registry: 
operator-sdk build openshift/console-operator:v0.0.1

# if its going to the official registry on quay:
docker tag openshift/console-operator:v0.0.1 quay.io/openshift/console-operator:latest
# if you are going to your own for testing:
# (just be sure you update your yaml files to reference your image)
docker tag openshift/console-operator:v0.0.1 \ 
   quay.io/benjaminapetersen/console-operator:latest 

# then push the image to the registry of your choice 
docker push quay.io/benjaminapetersen/console-operator:latest

# create a namespace for testing your operator. In the future, this will 
# be pinned to the `openshift-console` namespace.
kubectl create namespace test-project-name
oc new-project test-project-name

# under the /deploy directory, 
# make sure the ./deploy/operator.yaml references your image
# under spec.containers[].image
# Then, deploy your operator container:
kubectl create -f ./deploy/operator.yaml
oc create -f ./deploy/operator.yaml

# also deploy RBAC 
kubectl create -f ./deploy/rbac.yaml
oc create -f ./deploy/rbac.yaml

# and the custom resource definition (CRD), otherwise the APIs 
# for your custom resource will not exist and your deployment will
# not function.
# do note that your CRD is not namespaced, this is created once 
# per cluster and represents the API for your resource.
# (however, your CR "console" is namespaced).
# with this created, you can query or your resource via api calls to 
# /apis/
kubectl create -f ./deploy/crd.yaml
oc create -f ./deploy/crd.yaml  

# finally, you can create an instance of your custom resource (CR)
# once an instance exists, your operator will take over managing it 
kubectl create -f ./deploy/cr.yaml
oc create -f ./deploy/cr.yaml 

# now, check to ensure that your operator creates all of the resource
# that you expect for your custom resource to function.  
# for the console, this should be at least a deployment, service, route,
# configmap, and a secret.  
kubectl get deployments     // verify "console" exists and is happy
oc get deployments          // verify "console" exists and is happy
# etc.

# you can now declaratively make changes to your custom resource on the 
# fly by updating ./deploy/cr.yaml.  For example, update the number of 
# replicas generated by changing spec.count.  
kubectl apply -f deploy/cr.yaml
oc apply -f deploy/cr.yaml

# Do the same verification check to ensure your change was applied and 
# everything is happy:
kubectl get console/<name-of-console-pod> -o yaml   // this "get" references kind/name
oc get console/<name-of-console-pod> -o yaml        // this "get" references kind/name
# or, use the group as well:
kubectl get consoles.console.openshift.io
# and the name 
kubectl get consoles.console.openshift.io openshift-console
```

## Run Locally 

Its much easier to dev & run the binary locally (rather than build it, 
put it in a container, push the container, then deploy the container...repeat.)

If you are running with `oc cluster up`:
 
 - You may need to use a 3.9 or 3.10 release of `oc`
 - Make sure you provide a `--public-hostname` flag in order for the console to properly find the 
master public URL.  something like `oc cluster up --public-hostname=<your.ip.address>`
should suffice. 
- if you are running the `console` locally, then `export OPENSHIFT_API="<your.ip.address>"`
should match your `--public-hostname` flag (above)


Follow local dev instructions from `operator-sdk` including a few extras:

```bash 
# you need a cluster!
oc cluster up --public-hostname=<your.ip.address>
# create your operator namespace 
# for development, I have been deploying both the operator & the 
# console into one namespace called "openshift-console-operator-test"
oc create -f deploy/namespace.yaml
# however, long term, these will probably be broken out into:
oc create -f deploy/cr-namespace.yaml 
oc create -f deploy/operator-namespace.yaml 
# now, deploy the custom resource definition into your cluster: 
oc create -f deploy/crd.yaml
# and create the necessary RBAC resources:
oc create -f deploy/rbac.yaml 
# this is probably not necessary but feel free to run it.
# consult the sdk docs for more info:
operator-sdk generate k8s 
# build the binary, etc
# this will appear in tmp/_output/bin
operator-sdk build openshift/console-operator:v0.0.X
# optionally re-tag it to match a registry repo you can push to:
docker tag openshift/console-operator:v0.0.X \ 
   quay.io/<your.name>/console-operator:v0.0.X   # (or :latest)
# push it, if you are not running `operator-sdk up local`
docker push quay.io/<your.name>/console-operator:v0.0.X
# but it is probabaly easier to run locally for dev:
operator-sdk up local # this should do the trick
# finally, create a custom resource for the operator to watch:
# be sure you are within the `namespace` that your operator is watching. 
# for dev, if you did `oc create -f deploy/namespace.yaml`, then you should 
# be in `openshift-console-operator-test`
oc create -f deploy/cr.yaml
# the operator will look at this manifest & use it to generate 
# all of the deployments, etc that are needed for the resource to function.
```

## Dependencies

If OpenShift resources are needed (they will be), do the following:

```bash
# dep ensure will drop these if ran a second time, but no imports
# exist in the project.
dep ensure --add github.com/openshift/api
dep ensure --add github.com/openshift/client-go
```
